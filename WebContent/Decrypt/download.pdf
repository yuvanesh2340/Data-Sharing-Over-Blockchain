Cyber Security Governance and Management for Smart Grids in Brazilian Energy Utilities 399
The research reflects the fact that the board of directors of Brazilian energy utilities is not yet 
actively engaged in the operational decisions of cyber security. Even if shareholders and executives 
are interested or start the cyber security process, their previous planning occurs as isolated and 
operational initiatives and not as part of the process of corporate management and governance. 
Generally speaking, the conclusion is that all the dimensions described as a result of this study attend 
Brazilian energy utilities for the governance and management of cyber security for Smart Grids.
The dimension with the best evaluation from the experts, based on the criteria for adoption 
by Brazilian energy utilities, relevance for the Smart Grid stakeholders, relation with the improved 
performance and reduction of the operational risk was the management dimension which comprises 
the management of critical assets, whereas the dimension with the worst evaluation was the dimension 
of governance that handles the rights of the shareholders.
The present study points to insights for the theorization of this knowledge field rarely approached 
in literature. The dimensions presented can help in the application and operation of the model of 
governance and management of cyber security for other sectors. Especially in the scope of critical 
operation systems of the Brazilian electric system, the results showed that there are no plans for 
the detection, identification, analysis and response to threats and vulnerabilities in operational cyber 
security in Brazilian energy utilities.
